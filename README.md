# Generate-Tiktok-compilations
scripts that can be used to generate tiktok compilations with ffmpeg


Step 1: Download videos just using right-click download. Only works on some users

Step 2: Make two folders, Left and Center. Drop even number of files to both folders.

step 3a: fix the framerate of videos with `fix_framerate.ps1` if necessary (concat produces glitches or slow-motion in final video)

Step 3b: concatenate videos in same folder together using `concat.ps1`

Step 4: mirror the video video generated by concatenating the files in folder left with `mirror.ps1`

step 5: horizontally stack the left, center, and right videos using `hstack_Simp.ps1`

step 6: add audio using `add_audio.ps1`
